  In my last 2 years of university at Edinburgh, I started working as a coding tutor in an after school coding club in a
  primary school. We mainly taught block coding (like Scratch) and a little bit of Python. It was awesome!

  While working there, I had the idea that organising a hackathon for these kids could a great learning opportunity and
  also a ton of fun.
